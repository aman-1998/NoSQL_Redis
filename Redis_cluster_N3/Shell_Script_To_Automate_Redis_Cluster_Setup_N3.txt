=============================================
# Automate Redis Cluster setup and cleanup :
=============================================

# Redis cluster start :
------------------------

Here is a complete shell script that automates the entire Redis Cluster 
setup with 9 nodes (3 masters + 2 replicas each) running on ports 7000 to 7008

Create Script: redis-cluster-setup.sh (Check sample for reference)

How to Use It ?

1. Save the script to a file, e.g. :
-------------------------------------
nano setup-redis-cluster.sh

Paste the script and save with CTRL+O, Enter, then CTRL+X

2. Make it executable :
------------------------
chmod +x redis-cluster-setup.sh

3. Run it :
------------
./setup-redis-cluster.sh

4. After Success :
-------------------
Redis nodes run in background (daemonize yes)

Cluster is up and running

You can test:

redis-cli -c -p 7000
> set mykey hello
> get mykey


# Redis cluster stop :
-----------------------

Here is a shutdown and cleanup script for your Redis Cluster setup. 

This script:
-> Gracefully stops all Redis nodes (ports 7000–7008)
-> Deletes temporary files: nodes.conf, appendonly.aof, dump.rdb, and logs
-> Leaves the folder structure intact (you can restart later if needed)

Create Script: redis-cluster-stop-cleanup.sh (Check sample for reference)


How to Use It?

1. Save the script :
---------------------
nano shutdown-redis-cluster.sh

Paste the above, then CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X.

2. Make it executable :
------------------------
chmod +x shutdown-redis-cluster.sh

3. Run it :
------------
./shutdown-redis-cluster.sh


4. Want Full Cleanup ?
------------------------
If you want to completely delete the entire cluster folder, add this line at the end:

rm -rf "$BASE_DIR"


# Redis cluster restart :
--------------------------
This script restarts all Redis cluster nodes using their existing configuration files. 
It does not recreate the cluster, so your slot assignments and data remain 
intact (as long as nodes.conf and dump.rdb / appendonly.aof are preserved).

Create Script: restart-redis-cluster.sh (Check sample for reference)

To check if nodes are running again:

ps aux | grep redis-server

Or connect to one of them:

redis-cli -p 7000 cluster nodes


# Master Cluster Manager Script :
-----------------------------------
Here's a powerful yet simple master controller script for your Redis Cluster setup. 
This single script supports:

start – Start all Redis nodes

stop – Gracefully stop all nodes

restart – Restart nodes without destroying cluster state

cleanup – Remove logs, dump files, AOFs, and configs (but keeps folder structure)

purge – Stop everything and delete the entire cluster directory


Create Script: redis-cluster-manager.sh (Check sample for reference)


Use commands like:

./redis-cluster-manager.sh start      # Start nodes
./redis-cluster-manager.sh stop       # Stop nodes
./redis-cluster-manager.sh restart    # Restart nodes
./redis-cluster-manager.sh cleanup    # Clean logs/dumps/AOFs
./redis-cluster-manager.sh purge      # Wipe everything
